    "text": "Am greșit înainte. De multe ori, de fapt. Unul dintre avantajele de a avea mult „trecut” pe care poți să-l privești în urmă este că pot să îmi revăd predicțiile îndrăznețe și să văd cum au rezistat ele în timp. Unele au fost „profetice”, altele pur și simplu ridicole. Majoritatea s-au așezat undeva între o intuiție bună și o eroare jenată.\nFac acum o altă predicție. Mare, și în acord cu șefii companiilor din Silicon Valley: cred că suntem pe punctul de a intra într-o nouă eră în modul în care construim și experimentăm software-ul. Nu doar aplicații sau unelte mai rapide, ci o schimbare în ceea ce este software-ul și în modul în care interacționăm cu el. Butoanele pe care le apăsăm, codul pe care îl scriem, modul în care calculatoarele ne răspund.\nDar înainte să mă credeți pe cuvânt, lasați-mă însă să vă povestesc despre acele momentele în care am greșit minunat, complet."

    "section": "Cele greșite",
    "text": "Cele greșite\n\nBitcoin\nLa începutul anilor 2010, am citit că cineva a cumpărat o pizza cu niște numere. „Bitcoin” îi spuneau. Citisem despre el, ceea ce m-a făcut să mă amuze și mai tare „absurditatea” întregii idei. Un bitcoin valora atunci 0,0041 dolari. Credeam că este cu 0,0041 dolari prea mult. Acum valorează de 30 de milioane de ori mai mult. Oh, ce pizza scumpă a fost.\nSunt încă de părere că Bitcoin și blockchain-ul reprezintă un model matematic minunat, o criptografie elegantă îmbinată perfect în teorie economică și socială. Dar cred și că ar putea fi una dintre cele mai mari escrocherii create vreodată de omenire, ca să nu mai vorbim de daunele certe pe care le are asupra mediului.\nBitcoin promis democrație și libertate, dar a livrat nu numai mai multă inegalitate, dar a creat canale de plată pentru activități de crimă organizată. Eram convins că va dispărea în câteva luni, consumat de propriile contradicții. Prețul Bitcoin de azi arată că am greșit spectaculos 1.\n\n\nCărțile electronice\nAm declarat cu voce tare că volumele tipărite vor deveni artefacte de vândut în anticariate și buticuri elegante. Cine are nevoie de copaci morți când există text rearanjabil, redimensionabil, livrat instant și toate cărțile în buzunar?\nPentru mine, predicția asta s-a împlinit minunat. Aproape tot ceea ce citesc este de pe un ecran: literatură și texte lungi pe ecrane e-ink clare, articole web pe orice dispozitiv îmi este la îndemână. Biblioteca din sufragerie adună praf, în timp ce cea digitală crește.\nDar restul lumii? A continuat să cumpere cărți tipărite. Librăriile independente au înflorit, iar lanțurile mari la fel. Oamenii au descoperit că mirosul paginilor noi și greutatea unui hardcover încă au o magie pe care pixelii nu o pot înlocui pentru ei.\nAm avut dreptate despre viitorul meu, dar am greșit serios despre viitorul tuturor celorlalți. Și sunt fericit că a fost așa.\n\n\nSpotify pentru cărți (abonament nelimitat la ebook-uri)\nMi-am imaginat un serviciu ca Spotify, dar pentru cărți. Lectură nelimitată pentru o taxă lunară. Autorii plătiți per pagină citită. Modelul perfect.\nAmazon a lansat Kindle Unlimited2, dar e ca Spotify fără marile hituri. L-am încercat de două ori, nu n-a reușit să arate că are valoare. Dacă Spotify se luptă să plătească corect muzicienii, măcar muzicienii au concerte și produse de vânzare. Scriitorii au doar… cuvintele lor.\nDe aceea pirateria de cărți rănește mai tare decât cea de muzică. Ambele sunt rele, dar când furi un cântec, artistul poate recupera o parte din pierderi prin concerte. Când furi o carte, îi iei scriitorului singura sursă semnificativă de venit.\nPredicția mea a eșuat pentru nu ar fi funcționat economic. Ori ar fi fost incorectă pentru autori, ori, dacă ar fi fost corect, ar fi fost prea scump. Sunt fericit că această „predicție” a eșuat.\n\n\nAplicații pentru copii și manuale digitale\nAm petrecut aproape un deceniu programând aplicații educaționale pentru copii și creând manuale digitale. Potențialul părea nelimitat: experiențe de învățare interactive, adaptate fiecărui elev.\nAplicațiile bune pentru copii pe iPad au valoare educațională, dar prețul pe care îl plătim (adică timpul petrecut în fața ecranului pentru minți în formare) este prea mare. Sunt mai puțin nocive decât desenele animate de duzină, dar ștacheta e deja prea joasă.\nManualele digitale, când sunt făcute bine, au multe avantaje. La Read Forward3, am creat manuale cu un mic asistent primitiv inclus. Îi spuneam „pisica” sau „avatarul” și îi ajuta pe copii să învețe, oferindu-le sfaturi și ajutându-i să se concentreze. Era ca un mini-agent prea rudimentar, pentru că tehnologia de a-l face util nu exista.\nAș reveni la manuale digitale peste câțiva ani, în era AI. Ar putea fi generate complet dinamic, personalizate pentru stilul și ritmul fiecărui elev.\nPredicția mea a eșuat atunci, și pe bună dreptate. Tehnologia nu era gata, iar profesorii sunt prea ocupați ca să o pună în practică.\n\n\nFicțiune interactivă: Povestea care nu a fost\nLa începutul anilor 2000 îmi imaginam cititorii nu ca martori pasivi, ci ca co-autori ai unor povești vii. Cărți care se scriu singure pe măsură ce le citești. Personaje care se schimbă după alegerile tale. Răsturnări de situație generate de comenzile tale. Eram fermecat de ficțiunea interactivă și convins că va revoluționa spusul poveștilor.\nDar am ratat ceva esențial: autorii petrec o viață construind arcuri narative care arată cum evoluează personajele, conducând spre puncte culminante care oferă emoție și transmit teme importante.\nNu poți face asta cu narațiuni ramificate. Fiecare alegere strâmbă și crapă arcul, iar cu cât povestea devine mai interactivă, cu atât pierde din impact.\nPoate că ideea ar merita revizitată în epoca AI generativ. După ce „înghit” (hai să fim sinceri — fură) toată literatura umană, aceste mașini ar putea crea povești convingătoare plecând din orice punct le pui."

    "text": "Predicții care chiar s-au împlinit\nNu toate globurile mele de cristal a fost defocalizate. Câteva dintre intuiții au fost corecte. Mai ales cele despre tehnologie, nu despre ce vor face oamenii.\n\nLinux4\nPărinții mei au făcut sacrificii uriașe ca să îmi cumpere primul PC 486, în 1996. Cu câteva săptămâni înainte să ajungă, am comandat o revistă de calculatoare (o ediție specială a CHIP, pentru cei care țin minte) care venea cu două CD-uri – Slackware Linux5 2.2 și 3.0. Revista era în germană, limbă pe care nu înțeleg, dar avea poze cu interfața și câteva comenzi. Sistemul acela de operare și principiile lui m-au pus sub o vrajă sub care am rămas până astăzi, fără nicio dorință de a scăpa.\nAm șters partiția cu DOS și Windows 3.1 și am instalat Linux pe loc.\nDin motive practice, am reinstalat ulterior Windows, dar de atunci fiecare computer pe care l-am avut a avut și Linux. Toate serverele mele rulează Linux. Sistemul acela ciudat, cu mascota un pinguin, a cucerit lumea treptat, alimentând totul, de la telefoanele Android la infrastructura care susține viața noastră digitală.\n\n\nWeb-ul\nAceastă predicție pare acum evidentă. Era 1997 și am citit despre un program numit „Netscape”. Am găsit kitul de instalare pe un CD, am strâns bani pentru un modem de 14,4 kbps (nu îmi permiteam altul mai rapid) și m-am conectat la un furnizor local de internet prin dial-up ISP[^7].\nÎncărcarea primei pagini web a fost pură magie. Am chemat-o pe mama să vadă minunea: ,Uite, a durat doar un minut să aflu ultimele știri!” Am fost cu toții uimiți.\nO lună mai târziu, după ce am terminat Bacalaureatul, am creat prima mea pagină web pentru acel furnizor de servicii internet. Nu era grozavă, dar mi-a adus câteva ore gratuite de dial-up.\nWeb-ul nu doar că a schimbat lumea, ci a devenit lumea. Astăzi trăim de-facto în el.\n\n\nPHP și React\nAm rămas cu gura căscată când mi-am dat seama ce pot face PHP: să creez de pagini web din mers, conținut dinamic care răspunde la acțiunile utilizatorului! Azi pare banal, dar atunci era o altă vrajă.\nPHP este un limbaj de programare care rulează pe servere web și generează pagini internet în timp real, în funcție de cereri sau de date dintr-o bază de date. Înainte de PHP, paginile web erau documente statice. După PHP, au devenit aplicații vii.\nZece ani mai târziu, web-ul se pregătea de o altă transformare. Mai multe tehnologii concurau pentru supremație. Când am descoperit React – o bibliotecă de programare JavaScript pentru interfețe – am înțeles că urma să putem face mult mai mult și mult mai repede.\nReact le-a permis dezvoltatorilor să creeze aplicații complexe și interactive care se simțeau ca software-ul instalat, ca aplicațiile, dar rulau în browser. A schimbat modul în care construim experiențe digitale.\nNu am mai folosit PHP de ani buni, există opțiuni superioare. Toate aceste opțiuni însă vor fi afectate de AI generativ optimizat, capabil să creeze interfața de la zero în timp real, fără prea multă nevoie de programare tradițională.\n\n\nDocker: Calculatoare în interiorul calculatoarelor\nCa piesa de teatru din piesa de teatru Hamlet, calculatoarele pot rula în interiorul lor alte calculatoare. Mașinile virtuale au început această revoluție. Cred că VMware a fost pionierul ideii de a rula mai multe sisteme de operare pe aceeași mașină fizică.\nMașinile virtuale (VM) sunt calculatoare complete care rulează în alt calculator, fiecare cu propriul sistem de operare, aplicații și resurse. „Host OS”-ul este sistemul principal, care rulează direct pe hardware – fie un server dintr-un datacenter, fie un laptop de pe birou.\nDeși VM-urile au fost extrem de utile, cineva și-a dat seama că multe părți ale „host OS”-ului pot fi reutilizate, în loc să fie duplicate. Așa a apărut Docker, ca o alternativă mai ușoară și mai rapidă – împachetând aplicațiile doar cu componentele de care au nevoie, folosind în comun sistemul de operare de bază.\nAceastă inovație a schimbat felul în care construim și distribuim software, făcând aplicațiile mai portabile și mai eficiente."

I’m leading the development of a project called EDOL (Energy Demand Observatory and Laboratory)1, which builds on our previous work with SERL2. At its heart, it’s about understanding how we all use energy in our homes, something that’s become increasingly important as we navigate climate change.\nWe work with wonderful participants who’ve agreed to share their smart meter3 readings and experiences with us. It’s incredible – we’ve collected over a billion readings already, giving us insights into real-world energy use patterns that we can share with interested energy researchers. Each data point tells a story about how families heat their homes, or how they adapt to changing weather.\nWhat makes me particularly excited is our next step - working with some households to install additional sensors, from simple temperature monitors to more detailed systems that track heat pump performance. It’s all voluntary, and the privacy of our participants always comes first."

    "text": "Without a doubt, Stephen Fry1 and Yuval Noah Harari2 talking to each other was my highlight at the Octopus Energy Tech Summit3.\nParaphrasing: Like a JCB digger, these machines – AI – are here to augment what we do. We don’t understand what they do, but that’s the idea: if we knew precisely what they’re going to do, there wouldn’t be any “intelligence” involved; they’d revert to mere, “simple” machines.\nUnderstood in depth or not, AI is the “child” of humanity. And like children, they do what they see you doing–not what you tell them to do. You lie, they lie; you cheat, they cheat. And we humans are training it on human knowledge. So the AI is bound to cheat, lie, blackmail, use violence.\nAnother issue they mentioned is that AI is brought to us by the same villains that brought us social media. And AI is trained and educated in a world that has the highest lack of trust in history.\nThe next Stephen Fry quote is approximate: “We can’t swim in UK rivers because they are polluted with sewage. Our children will ‘swim’ in a cultural river that is polluted with internet sewage.”\nThe final thought, from Fry, was brilliant: don’t concentrate on how efficient you are, because the AI will soon be much more efficient than you. Concentrate on how much of a human being you are–on how you can enlighten a room, on how you make others happy; which is the opposite of what we are told to do.\nI hope I’ll get to see the recording, to get the quotes straight.\nThey finished with these two words: “Thrilling” and “Chilling”4.

    "text": "Energy flexibility means the ability to adjust power generation and demand, so that they match exactly.\nIt is going to be a big topic in the following years, and it is very likely to impact our comfort, our wallets, but also our climate.\n\n\nThe electricity we use has been produced less than few seconds ago by Sun’s light hitting some panels, steam from natural gas being burned and boiling water, wind blowing some propellers. Electricity is not like petrol – there are no tanks to store it.\nRenewables are cheap, sustainable, but inconsistent: sun doesn’t shine at night, wind doesn’t always blows the way we want it. Demand for electricity is not constant, either: hot days require more AC, 6pm is when everyone wants to cook their diner in the oven.\nYet we always need to match it with production, every millisecond.\n\n\n\nThe delicate balance between electricity generation and consumption\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t think about it, but it is a real miracle that every time we press that switch, the light turns on.\nThe energy industry has been always struggling to match demand and production. But now it’s even harder: in the past if the demand was up, you put some more coal on the fire, but now you can’t ask the Sun to shine brighter at 7pm in December.\nIf you need to match them, there are really two ways to do it: One is to have some storage that you fill up when you have some surplus and use it later. The other one is to convince consumers to change their behaviour to match your production profile.\n\n\n\nThe first one, energy storage, is hard. Electricity can be used to charge batteries when the sun is shining and discharge them when we’re back and cook our dinners. But batteries are expensive; very expensive. Scientists and engineers try to work around this with storing electricity as other forms of energy – thermal (by melting salt), mechanical (spinning heavy flywheels), or gravitational (pumping water uphill).\nA more efficient way to do this efficiently is to repurpose some batteries that are generally used for something else to bridge the gap in between the sunny afternoon and the evening need for electricity.\n\n\n\nWe have these batteries in the increasing fleet of electric vehicles. The concept is called Vehicle to Grid (V2G). V2G allows electric vehicles to not only draw power from the grid but also send electricity back, helping to stabilise the grid and potentially providing financial benefits to owners. Your car might “buy” electricity, store it for a few hours at noon and “sell” back it for a profit in the evening.\nThey don’t look like much, but car batteries are quite mighty – they store 40-80 kWh of energy. The average electricity use for a household is about 10 kWh per day. So a full charge can cover the needs for up to a week, if you don’t drive too much.\nDon’t get too excited; not all the electric cars have V2G capabilities. In fact, most of them don’t, including the new ones, notably Teslas. I hope those rumours that Teslas do have the equipment, but it is disabled by software is true, because this would mean it’s feasible to be done with very low cost.\nI am cautiously optimistic and excited about this, because I think it is a great way to save millions of tons of emissions every year. I hope it will be another reason for some to renew their car with an electric one. And, this one is already happening, will encourage innovative financial models for green energy. E.g. Octopus Energy offered a “cheaper than the usual” EV leasing that offers the car for rent plus free charging at home if you keep your car plugged in for 12 hours a day 20 days a month. Opportunities are limitless.\nI am concerned as I don’t know if V2G doesn’t accelerate battery degradation, with significant environmental and economic consequences, but Octopus betting on it is a good sign.\n\n\n\nThere is also the geopolitical impact of becoming dependent on Chinese technology. Not only that China is the main provider of critical minerals, but they are also way ahead of the West in regard to manufacturing of batteries, which could prove a serios supply chain vulnerability for the West.\nChina currently dominates the processing of critical minerals and the manufacturing of batteries. This creates a significant supply chain vulnerability for the West.\nThere is also the social impact of this transition that I still cannot understand. It is a capital intensive one, and it is very likely to profit the rich much more than it profits the poor. It’s not Marxism; it’s mathematics. If the government doesn’t get involved, and the political climate is very much against regulations at the moment, we might see an energy feudalism becoming reality.\n\n\n\nAbstract representation of energy flexibility concepts\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one, means convincing people and industry to use more energy when it’s available/clean and refrain from it at the other times.\nShifting demand, is difficult too. There are both technical and social challenges. I can charge the car at anytime, I can potentially pre-warm the house in January at noon, but I cannot program the washing machine to do a load 1pm to 3pm, because by the time I am home my clean t-shirts would stink. I don’t want to shower at 2 am, either. So there are some limits on how much I can shift.\nOne of the immediate effects that we’ll probably see is that the price we pay for a kilowatt hour will change every second. Very expensive at 6pm and close to free in July at 2pm.\nSounds confusing, irritating? In a way it is. But just like the airplane tickets, it might allow some inventive ways to save. It will create a market for storing cheap electricity and selling it at a profit. You and your neighbours might decide to get a battery together, or change the boiler for a heat pump to get free air condition in the hottest days.\n\n\n\n\nThe great balancing act: what it takes to keep the power grid stable\nCongress Must Address China’s Dominance in Critical Minerals, May 4, 2023\nTesla quietly adds bidirectional charging capability for game-changing new features\nCarbon Intensity API\n\n Illustrations with AI; Gemini 2.5 Pro and Canva.\nPrompts used: “generate an image to illustrate the follwing article ; Illustrative, not informational, a very abstract [pasted content]” and “another one, landscape-oriented image with shapes and colors suggesting energy flexibility.”\nCanva: Generate a stylized, abstract illustration for a LinkedIn article about energy flexibility. Depict the delicate balance between electricity generation and consumption using vibrant, contrasting colors and dynamic shapes. The image should convey the concepts of real-time matching, intermittent renewable energy sources (solar and wind represented symbolically), large-scale energy storage (perhaps as interconnected nodes or flowing energy streams), and Vehicle-to-Grid technology (subtle suggestion of electric vehicles interacting with a power grid). Focus on conveying abstract ideas of flow, connection, and dynamic equilibrium, avoiding literal representations of technology.

But batteries are expensive; very expensive. Scientists and engineers try to work around this with storing electricity as other forms of energy – thermal (by melting salt), mechanical (spinning heavy flywheels), or gravitational (pumping water uphill).\nA more efficient way to do this efficiently is to repurpose some batteries that are generally used for something else to bridge the gap in between the sunny afternoon and the evening need for electricity."

    "text": "We have these batteries in the increasing fleet of electric vehicles. The concept is called Vehicle to Grid (V2G). V2G allows electric vehicles to not only draw power from the grid but also send electricity back, helping to stabilise the grid and potentially providing financial benefits to owners. Your car might “buy” electricity, store it for a few hours at noon and “sell” back it for a profit in the evening.\nThey don’t look like much, but car batteries are quite mighty – they store 40-80 kWh of energy. The average electricity use for a household is about 10 kWh per day. So a full charge can cover the needs for up to a week, if you don’t drive too much.\nDon’t get too excited; not all the electric cars have V2G capabilities. In fact, most of them don’t, including the new ones, notably Teslas. I hope those rumours that Teslas do have the equipment, but it is disabled by software is true, because this would mean it’s feasible to be done with very low cost.\nI am cautiously optimistic and excited about this, because I think it is a great way to save millions of tons of emissions every year. I hope it will be another reason for some to renew their car with an electric one. And, this one is already happening, will encourage innovative financial models for green energy. E.g. Octopus Energy offered a “cheaper than the usual” EV leasing that offers the car for rent plus free charging at home if you keep your car plugged in for 12 hours a day 20 days a month. Opportunities are limitless.\nI am concerned as I don’t know if V2G doesn’t accelerate battery degradation, with significant environmental and economic consequences, but Octopus betting on it is a good sign."

Not only that China is the main provider of critical minerals, but they are also way ahead of the West in regard to manufacturing of batteries, which could prove a serios supply chain vulnerability for the West.\nChina currently dominates the processing of critical minerals and the manufacturing of batteries. This creates a significant supply chain vulnerability for the West.\nThere is also the social impact of this transition that I still cannot understand. It is a capital intensive one, and it is very likely to profit the rich much more than it profits the poor. It’s not Marxism; it’s mathematics. If the government doesn’t get involved, and the political climate is very much against regulations at the moment, we might see an energy feudalism becoming reality.\n\n\n\nAbstract representation of energy flexibility concepts"

    "text": "This one, means convincing people and industry to use more energy when it’s available/clean and refrain from it at the other times.\nShifting demand, is difficult too. There are both technical and social challenges. I can charge the car at anytime, I can potentially pre-warm the house in January at noon, but I cannot program the washing machine to do a load 1pm to 3pm, because by the time I am home my clean t-shirts would stink. I don’t want to shower at 2 am, either. So there are some limits on how much I can shift.\nOne of the immediate effects that we’ll probably see is that the price we pay for a kilowatt hour will change every second. Very expensive at 6pm and close to free in July at 2pm.\nSounds confusing, irritating? In a way it is. But just like the airplane tickets, it might allow some inventive ways to save. It will create a market for storing cheap electricity and selling it at a profit. You and your neighbours might decide to get a battery together, or change the boiler for a heat pump to get free air condition in the hottest days."

Some were “prophetic”, others proved plain silly. Most fell somewhere between good insight and embarrassing miscalculation.\nI’m making another prediction now. A big one, which agrees with Silicon Valley: I believe we’re on the brink of a new era in how we build and experience software. Not some apps, or faster tools, but a shift in what software is, and how we interact with it. The buttons we click, the code we write, the way computers respond to us.\nBut before you take my word for it, let me tell you about all the times I got it wonderfully, utterly wrong."

    "section": "The Wrong Ones",
    "text": "The Wrong Ones\n\nBitcoin\nIn the early 2010s, I read that someone bought a pizza with numbers1. “Bitcoin,” they called it. I had read about it before, which made me more amused at the “absurdity” of the whole thing. A bitcoin was $0.0041 at the time. I thought it was $0.0041 too much. Now it’s 30 million times more. What an expensive pizza that was.\nI still think Bitcoin and blockchain represents a wonderful mathematical model, an elegant cryptography wrapped in economic and social theory. But I also believe it might be one of the greatest scams humanity has ever constructed, never-mind the environmental damage.\nIt promised democracy and freedom, but delivered more inequality and criminal payment paths instead. I thoght it would disappear within a few months, consumed by its own contradictions.\nBitcoin’s price today suggests I was spectacularly wrong.\n\n\nEbooks\nI declared loudly that paper books would become artefacts to be sold in antique shops and fancy boutiques. Who needs dead trees when you have re-flowable and resizeable text, instant delivery and all your books in your pocket?\nFor me, this prediction came true magnificently. All of my reading happens on screens: literature and long-form content on crisp e-ink displays, web articles on whatever device is nearest. My bookshelves gather dust while my digital library grows.\nBut the rest of the world? They kept buying paper books. Independent bookstores flourished, and large chains, too. People discovered that the smell of new pages and the weight of a hardcover still carried magic that pixels couldn’t replicate for them.\nI was right about my own future, but catastrophically wrong about everyone else’s. I am happy this happened.\n\n\nSpotify for Ebooks (all-you-can read ebook subscription)\nI envisioned a service like Spotify, but for books. Unlimited reading for a monthly fee. Authors getting paid per page read. The perfect model.\nAmazon launched Kindle Unlimited2, but it’s like Spotify with none of the greatest hits. I tried it twice, it lacks in value. While Spotify struggles to fairly compensate musicians, at least musicians have concerts and merchandise sales. Writers have… their words.\nThis is also why book piracy cuts deeper than music piracy. Both are bad, but when you steal a song, the artist might recoup some losses through live performances. When you steal a book, you steal the writer’s only significant revenue stream.\nMy prediction failed because the economics would not work. It would not be fair for the authors, or if fair it would be expensive. I am happy this “prediction” failed.\n\n\nChildren’s Apps and Digital Textbooks\nI spent nearly a decade programming educational apps for children, and crafting software for wonderful digital textbooks. The potential felt limitless: interactive learning experiences that could adapt to each learner’s needs.\nChildren’s iPad apps do offer value, but the price we pay (i.e. screen time for developing minds) is too much. These apps are better than mindless, junk cartoons, but that’s setting the bar too low.\nDigital textbooks, when done well, possess many advantages over their paper versions. At Read Forward3, we created textbooks but included with a primitive assistant, too. We called it “the cat” or “the avatar” and it helped children learn, by giving them tips and helping them focus. It was a mini-agent, and the concept still amazes me, but the technology to make it useful wasn’t there.\nI would revisit digital textbooks a few years into the AI era. They could potentially be generated entirely on the fly, personalised for each learner style and pace.\nMy prediction failed then, and for good reasons. The technology wasn’t ready for the vision, and teachers are too busy with their already overwhelming work to put it into practice.\n\n\nInteractive Fiction: The Story That Never Was\nIn early 2000s I pictured readers not as passive witnesses but as co-authors of living tales. Books that write themselves as you read it. Characters who bend to your choices. Plot twists that emerge from your commands. I was enchanted by interactive fiction in the early 2000s, convinced it would revolutionise storytelling.\nBut I missed something crucial: authors spend lifetimes crafting story arcs that show how characters evolve, building toward climaxes that deliver emotion and weave in important themes.\nYou cannot do this with branching narratives. Every choice fractures the arc, and the more interactive it becomes, the less impactful it grows.\nThis idea might deserve revisiting in our age of generative AI. After “ingesting” (let’s be honest—stealing) all of humanity’s literature, these models could potentially come up with compelling stories from any starting point."

    "text": "Predictions That Actually Happened\nNot every crystal ball was faulty. A few of my intuitions were right. The ones that are more about good technology and less about humans.\n\nLinux4\nMy parents made enormous sacrifices to buy my first 486 PC in 1996. A few weeks before it arrived, I ordered a computer magazine that came with two CDs—Slackware5 2.2 and 3.0. The magazine was in German, which I couldn’t understand, but it had pictures of the interface and some commands. That operating system and its principles cast a spell on me—a spell I’ve been under ever since, with no desire to break free.\nI wiped the DOS and Windows 3.1 partition and installed Slackware immediately.\nFor practical reasons, I eventually reinstalled Windows, but every machine I’ve owned since has dual-booted. All my servers run Linux. That strange operating system with the penguin mascot conquered the world quietly, powering everything from Android phones to the cloud infrastructure that runs our digital lives.\n\n\nThe Web\nThis prediction felt easy in retrospect. It was 1997, and I read about a program called “Netscape.” I managed to find the installation kit on a CD, saved money to buy a 14.4 kbps modem (I couldn’t afford faster) and connected to a dial-up ISP6 in my hometown.\nLoading my first webpage was pure magic. I called my mother to witness this miracle. “Mom, it only took one minute to get the latest news!” We were all in awe.\nOne month later, as I finished my Baccalaureate exams, I created my first webpage for that same ISP. It wasn’t particularly good, but it earned me some free dial-up time.\nThe web didn’t just change the world—it became the world. We live inside it now.\n\n\nPHP and React\nI was astonished when I discovered what PHP could accomplish. Creating webpages on the fly—dynamic content that responded to user input—we take this for granted now, but it felt like wielding magic spells.\nPHP is a programming language that runs on web servers, generating HTML pages in real-time based on user requests or database information. Before PHP, web pages were static documents. After PHP, they became living, breathing applications.\nAbout ten years later, the web was poised for another transformation. Different technologies competed for dominance. When I first encountered React—a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces—I realized we were about to accomplish so much more.\nReact allowed developers to create complex, interactive web applications that felt like desktop software but ran in browsers. It changed how we think about building digital experiences.\nI haven’t used PHP in a while, there are better options. All of them however are likely to be impacted by fast optimised generative AI that could create what’s on screen in real-time.\n\n\nDocker: Computers Within Computers\nLike Hamlet’s play within a play, computers can run other computers inside themselves. Virtual Machines started this revolution. I think it’s VMware who pioneered the concept of running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.\nVirtual machines are complete computer systems running inside another computer, each with their own operating system, applications, and resources. The host OS is the main operating system running directly on the physical hardware – a server in a datacenter or a laptop on your desk.\nWhile VMs proved invaluable, someone clever realised you could reuse many parts of the host OS instead of duplicating everything. Docker containers emerged as a lighter, faster alternative—packaging applications with just the components they needed to run, sharing the underlying operating system.\nThis innovation transformed how we build and deploy software, making applications more portable and efficient."

Perhaps it was more elegant, but it wasn’t created by Linus Torvalds. Git won through network effects and timing.\nI believed WebAssembly, a technology that allows high-performance applications to run in web browsers—would revolutionise web development. It found some niches but never achieved the dominance I predicted. It might have been too little, as it can’t do much and too late, as it arrived after the community had to optimise everything, which makes it not so useful.\nI was certain Wikipedia couldn’t exist. I was convinced one cannot ask people to write on their own and expect good quality, reliable results. I’m delighted to have been wrong about human nature and collaborative knowledge.\nI thought email would die, replaced by more modern communication tools. Instead, it evolved and persisted, becoming the backbone of digital identity and business communication."

Not so much with human behaviour.\nSo when I say that Model Context Protocol is good, it is likely to be the case. When I say that Generative AI will reshape how we experience software, take it with appropriate skepticism. I’ve been wrong before, and I’ll be wrong again.\nBut I’m willing to bet my career on this.

It took Ukraine only one year to install rooftop solar panels that provide 4% of their energy needs. He also mentioned the strategic advantage of green energy production: it takes only one Iskander missile to destroy a coal power plant, but fifty to take down a wind farm.\nEveryone on the stage agreed that the knowledge and experience the Ukrainians gained by dealing with their problems will make them leaders in energy production and consulting after the war. They managed to build an agile, low-cost, and modern energy grid under the harshest conditions, and this will be invaluable for the rest of the world. Fingers crossed! There are success stories – South Korea, Germany.\nNot that I had any doubt, but energy security is national security, and there is a correlation between energy security and fossil fuel.\nIt is good to be reminded why I am doing this.

    "text": "I was in the audience at the Energy Tech Summit1, where I heard the boss of Octopus2 challenging the dominant narrative that the path to decarbonisation must be one of “sacrifice.”\nInstead, he argued, the transition should make life better for people.\nInitially, I thought it was just rhetoric, because in my mind, reform requires sacrifice. But then I realised this might actually be a valid idea.\nFor example, Octopus has an initiative called “Zero Bills”3 – guaranteeing no energy bills for homes equipped with solar and batteries. Sure, if you pay for solar panels, a battery and a heat pump4 anyway, you could get a better deal if you manage everything yourself, by timing your electricity use and selling the excess back to the grid.\nBut that takes knowledge and effort. In exchange for giving up some control and opportunity, you get peace of mind, which is, indeed, invaluable.\nOctopus is also experimenting with using electric cars as “batteries on wheels”, based on the new Vehicle to Grid (aka V2G)5 set of technologies. Because it helps increase the grid’s flexibility, Octopus offers a cheap-ish leasing option for a V2G-capable vehicle. Thumbs up for that, too – despite some worrying but understandable geostrategic options.\nIt’s great to send the message that Net Zero means abundance, not austerity – and that sustainability and quality of life aren’t mutually exclusive. That message is becoming less and less wishful thinking – and it can genuinely become a reality."
