            I am Cristian Dinu — a software engineer working at the boundary between climate, data, and research.
            I help make energy data more accessible to researchers through secure, reliable, human-focused software.
            Currently, I am a Senior Research Software Engineer at
            <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UCL</a>, contributing to the
            <a href="https://serl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Energy Research Lab (SERL)</a>
            and
            <a href="https://edol.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy Demand Observatory and
                Laboratory (EDOL)</a>,
            where I lead the technical development of systems that support energy research at scale.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I work closely with the
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ucl-smart-energy-research-group/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Energy Research Group (SERG)</a>
            at the UCL Energy Institute, part of The Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources.
            My work focuses on designing and building data infrastructure to enable UK researchers to access
            rich energy datasets while maintaining strong privacy protections.
        </p>
        <p>
            I lead the technical development of two flagship projects: SERL and EDOL. These platforms securely
            collect and enrich household energy data from smart meters, environmental sensors, surveys, and IoT
            devices. They are designed to comply with strict data governance and smart meter regulations while
            remaining useful to a wide range of researchers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before UCL, I co-founded <a href="https://hypersay.com" target="_blank">Hypersay</a>, a platform
            for online events and real-time presentation engagement. That experience continues to shape my belief
            that software should be not only functional but intuitive, human-centred, and robust.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently exploring how emerging AI technologies — especially language models (LLMs), diffusion
            models, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — can transform how people interact with computers,
            moving beyond traditional user interfaces.
