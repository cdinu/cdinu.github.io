## ðŸ–– Hi!

Iâ€™m [@cdinu](https://twitter.com/cdinu), co-founder of [Hypersay](https://hypersay.com/), a platform for interactive presentations that massively increases audience engagement. Let's [get in touch](https://hypersay.com/) if you want to learn more about it.

Hypersay is the result of a long evolution that started in 2012 in Bucharest and which continues since 2015 in London.

I started my entrepreneurial life early. In a past life I was an eager corporate bee, in companies such as Vodafone and IBM. I liked it a lot, but at some point I decided that I prefer a different lifestyle. I am grateful for everything I learnt and I am what I am today because of, not despite of my corporate experience.

I love to share my findings, skills and knowledge, and this is why I have been constantly involved in training and education. Since 2003 Iâ€™ve conducted dozens of training sessions with thousands of participants in corporate, university or social spaces around topics such as management, entrepreneurship and computers.

I am always striving to learn new things, not only in management and technology. About one year ago, I decided to to learn to play an instrument. I am member of a Recorder Group and I am also slowly learning how to play the piano.

Despite being fairly pragmatic, I am still quite an idealist, actively assuming I can change the world.

I write code, Star Trek ranks high in my preferences, and I get Sheldon's science jokes, but i am a friendly and easygoing geek: science and computers are my thing, but I enjoy talking about all things: language, history, literature - and of course cycling.

Thanks for stopping by and letâ€™s chat! Find me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cristian.dinu.infoideea), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cdinu) or email, first and last name at gmail. Phone number hidden in credits.
