## 🖖 Hi!

I’m [@cdinu](https://twitter.com/cdinu), co-founder of [Hypersay](https://hypersay.com/), a platform for interactive presentations that massively increases audience engagement. Let's [get in touch](https://hypersay.com/) if you want to learn more about it.

Hypersay is the result of a long evolution that started in 2012 in Bucharest and which continues since 2015 in London.

I started my entrepreneurial life early. In a past life I was an eager corporate bee, in companies such as Vodafone and IBM. I liked it a lot, but at some point I decided that I prefer a different a lifestyle. I am grateful for everything I learnt and I am what I am today because of, not despite my corporate experience.

I love to share my findings, skills and knowledge, and this is why I have been constantly involved in training and education. Since 2003 i’ve conducted dozens of training sessions with thousands of participants in corporate, university or social spaces around topics such as management, entrepreneurship and computers.

I am always striving to learn new things, not only on management and technology. About one year ago I decided to to learn to play an instrument. I am member of a Recorder Group and I am also slowly learning how to play the piano.

Despite being fairly pragmatic, I am still quite an idealist, actively assuming I can change the world.

I write code, Star Trek is high in my preferences, and I get Sheldon's science jokes, but i am a friendly and easygoing geek: science and computers are my things, but I enjoy talking about languages, history, literature, social media, science, and of course cycling.

Thanks for stopping by and let’s chat (find me also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cristian.dinu.infoideea), [LinkedIn](httpd://linkedin.com/in/cdinu) or email, first and last name at gmail).
