My talk just got accepted for RSECon25 [@rsecon25] in September! I'm going to share how Large Language Models (LLMs) might just ditch the need for traditional "apps" and programs.

Most software still talks in buttons, charts, forms, pop-ups. But what if you could skip them entirely and get your data or perform actions the way you talk to a person?

In the walkthrough, I'll show how LLMs (like ChatGPT) can become your front-end, powered by a new thing called the Model Context Protocol (MCP) [@model_context_protocol]. It lets you plug in real-time, structured data directly into a conversational agent.

I'll demo how to build an MCP server, show what works (and what doesn't), and share patterns I've seen when replacing traditional apps with this approach.
