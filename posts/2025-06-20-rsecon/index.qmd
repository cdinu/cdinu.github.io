My talk just got accepted for RSECon25 [@rsecon25] in September! I'm going to share how Large Language Models (LLMs) might just ditch the need for traditional "apps" and programs.

Most software still talks in buttons, charts, forms, pop-ups. But what if you could skip them entirely and get your data or perform actions the way you talk to a person?

In the walkthrough, I'll show how LLMs (like ChatGPT) can become your front-end, powered by a new thing called the Model Context Protocol (MCP) [@model_context_protocol]. It lets you plug in real-time, structured data directly into a conversational agent.

I'll demo how to build an MCP server, show what works (and what doesn't), and share patterns I've seen when replacing traditional apps with this approach.

If you're into data, software, or just curious where interfaces are going next -- come by and say hi.
